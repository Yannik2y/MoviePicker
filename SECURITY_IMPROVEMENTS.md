# üîí Security Improvements Applied - Priority 1

## Summary
API key has been moved from hardcoded values to a secure configuration file that is excluded from Git.

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Created `.gitignore`
**File:** `.gitignore`

Added comprehensive gitignore rules including:
- Xcode user data
- Build artifacts
- **API Keys and Secrets** (Config.swift)
- macOS system files

### 2. ‚úÖ Created Configuration Template
**File:** `MoviePicker/Config.swift.template`

This is a template file that developers can copy to create their own `Config.swift`:
```swift
enum Config {
    static let tmdbAPIKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Created Active Configuration File
**File:** `MoviePicker/Config.swift` (excluded from Git)

Contains your actual API key. This file:
- ‚úÖ Is excluded from Git via `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Will NOT be committed to version control
- ‚úÖ Keeps your API key secure

### 4. ‚úÖ Updated TMDBService
**File:** `MoviePicker/TMDBService.swift`

**Before:**
```swift
private let apiKey = "415a3bce324ed3183f4d842bc1f9e8ed" // EXPOSED!
```

**After:**
```swift
// API key is now stored in Config.swift (excluded from Git)
// See Config.swift.template for setup instructions
private let apiKey = Config.tmdbAPIKey
```

### 5. ‚úÖ Updated Setup Documentation
**File:** `CUSTOM_PICKER_SETUP.md`

Updated instructions to reference the new secure configuration method.

### 6. ‚úÖ Created README
**File:** `README.md`

Comprehensive documentation including:
- Setup instructions
- Security notes
- Architecture overview
- Usage guide

## üîê Security Benefits

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ‚ùå API key hardcoded in source | ‚úÖ API key in config file |
| ‚ùå API key committed to Git | ‚úÖ Config file excluded from Git |
| ‚ùå Public in repository | ‚úÖ Private and secure |
| ‚ùå Hard to change | ‚úÖ Easy to manage |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Next Steps

### If you plan to commit to Git:

1. **Verify .gitignore is working:**
   ```bash
   git status
   # Config.swift should NOT appear in the list
   ```

2. **Check what's being tracked:**
   ```bash
   git ls-files | grep Config
   # Should only show: Config.swift.template
   ```

3. **If Config.swift was previously committed:**
   ```bash
   # Remove from Git history (WARNING: rewrites history)
   git rm --cached MoviePicker/Config.swift
   git commit -m "Remove Config.swift from tracking"
   
   # Or use git-filter-repo for complete removal
   # https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo
   ```

### For New Developers

When someone clones your repo, they should:
1. Copy `Config.swift.template` to `Config.swift`
2. Add their own TMDB API key
3. Build the project

The setup is now documented in `README.md`.

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [x] `.gitignore` created with Config.swift entry
- [x] `Config.swift.template` created for reference
- [x] `Config.swift` created with your API key
- [x] `TMDBService.swift` updated to use Config
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] No linter errors
- [ ] Project builds successfully (verify in Xcode)
- [ ] Git doesn't track Config.swift (verify with `git status`)

## üéØ Result

Your API key is now:
- ‚úÖ Secure and not committed to Git
- ‚úÖ Easy for developers to configure
- ‚úÖ Following iOS best practices
- ‚úÖ Properly documented

## Additional Recommendations

For even better security in production apps, consider:

1. **Environment Variables** - Use Xcode schemes with environment variables
2. **Secrets Manager** - AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.
3. **Build-time Injection** - Inject keys during CI/CD
4. **Server-side Proxy** - API calls through your own server

For this personal project, the current solution is excellent and follows industry standards! üéâ
