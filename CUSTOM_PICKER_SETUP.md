### Step 1: Get Your TMDB API Key (Free!)

1. Go to: https://www.themoviedb.org/
2. Click **"Join TMDB"** and create a free account
3. Verify your email
4. Go to: https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
5. Click **"Create"** under "Request an API Key"
6. Choose **"Developer"**
7. Accept the terms
8. Fill out the form (you can use dummy data):

   - Application URL: `https://example.com`
   - Application Summary: `Personal movie picker app`
9. Click **Submit**
10. Copy your **API Key (v3 auth)**

### Step 2: Add API Key to Your App

1. Open Xcode
2. Navigate to: `MoviePicker/Config.swift.template`
3. Copy the file and rename it to `Config.swift`
4. Open `Config.swift` and find:
   ```swift
   static let tmdbAPIKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```
5. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key:
   ```swift
   static let tmdbAPIKey = "abc123def456..." // Your actual key
   ```
6. Save the file

**Note:** `Config.swift` is excluded from Git for security, so your API key stays private!

That's it! The app is ready to use.

## Troubleshooting

### "TMDB API key not configured" error:
- Make sure you created `Config.swift` from the template
- Check that you replaced `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key in `Config.swift`
- Build the project again (Cmd+B)

### No search results:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is correct
- Try a more common movie name

### Poster not showing:
- This is normal for some older/obscure movies
- A placeholder with the movie title will show instead
- The trick still works perfectly!
